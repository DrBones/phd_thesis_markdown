Here will be some nice teaser with a picture of our gas or so.

## Superfluidity in strongly interacting 2D Bose gases.

This work focusses on the study of ultra cold strongly correlated 2D gases, their phase coherence properties and the possibility of superfluidity. Unfortunately, for the most prominent phase of superfluidity, a Bose Einstein condensate (BEC), higher dimensions are necessary and 2D is the marginal dimension for its existence (xx). Hence, it is instructive to consider ultra cold 3D gases first, where the concepts of condensation and superfluidity are much easier understood. The line of reasoning will loosely follow the excellent review of Hadzibabic and Dalibard @Dalibard

In this chapter, we will consider a homogenous 3D Bose gas at low temperatures and show that the gas will undergo a phase transition where the ground state will be macroscopically populated below a critical Temperature T~crit~ > 0. This is due to the rapid decrease of the density of states (DOS) towards low energies (DOS(E) → 0 for E → 0) and thus "not enough excited states" for the particles to inhabit. Hence, they will *condense* into the ground state, this phase is called a Bose Einstein condensate.

Since the particles inhabit the same state, the phases of their wave functions (better order parameter?) are identical. Looking at the coherence or "sameness" of the phase over a distance yields thus a constant result. The gas exhibits long range order (LRO).

If the particles of the Bose gas are interacting with each other, this condensate will display superfluidity. That means that flow below a critical velocity v~c~ > 0 will be frictionless. This velocity is given by the minimal slope of the Bogoluibov dispersion relation (i.e the group velocity of the lowest excitation). The Landau criterion @Landau1941 states that below this velocity the gas is energetically stable under small perturbations.
Here, the onset of condensation and superfluidity coincide.

In contrast, in a homogenous 2D gas at low temperatures, a macroscopic population of the ground state for all temperatures except T=0 is notably absent. The gas does not condense. This is due to a constant DOS even for E → 0, allowing a distribution of the particles to the excited states at any temperature T>0.
Hence, according to the usual Einstein argument, there exists no BEC in a homogenous 2D system for any finite temperature.

Again, investigating the phase of the order parameter, one can show that the population of low energy sates destroys the coherence for large distances. Thise  eis generalized in the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem @Hohenberg1967 @Mermin1966 @Coleman1973
