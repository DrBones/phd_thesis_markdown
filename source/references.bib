@article{Kosterlitz2002,
abstract = {A new definition of order called topological order is proposed for two-dimensional systems in which no long-range order of the conventional type exists. The possibility of a phase transition characterized by a change in the response of the system to an external perturbation is discussed in the context of a mean field type of approximation. The critical behaviour found in this model displays very weak singularities. The application of these ideas to the xy model of magnetism, the solid-liquid transition, and the neutral superfluid are discussed. This type of phase transition cannot occur in a superconductor nor in a Heisenberg ferromagnet.},

abstract = {The asymptotic behavior of the correlations in the low-temperature phase are found for the following two-dimensional quantum systems: a two-dimensional lattice of plane rotators, two-dimensional mag- netic substances having an easy plane of magnetization, a two-dimensional Bose liquid (Sec. 1), and a two-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg ferromagnet (Sec. 2). The nature of the change of the asymptotic behavior with increasing temperature is investigated for the systems considered in Sec. 1. The nature of the change of the asymptotic behavior with increasing temperature is investigated for the systems considered in Sec. 1. The nature of the low-temperature phase consists in the superfluidity of a two- dimensional Bose liquid; the corresponding property can also be formulated in terms of magnetic substances.},

@article{Coleman1973,
abstract = {In four dimensions, it is possible for a scalar field to have a vacuum expectation value that would be forbidden if the vacuum were invariant under some continuous transformation group, even though this group is a symmetry group in the sense that the associated local currents are conserved. This is the Goldstone phenomenon, and Goldstone's theorem states that this phenomenon is always accompanied by the appearance of massless scalar bosons. The purpose of this note is to show that in two dimensions the Goldstone phenomenon can not occur; Goldstone's theorem does not end with two alternatives (either manifest symmetry or Goldstone bosons) but with only one (manifest symmetry).},
